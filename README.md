# MicroWaves - CrimsonHacks 2017

This web application is designed to locate and report the location of microwaves on The Univeristy of Alabama campus. The project was created for CrimsonHacks 2017.

The building blocks for this project are Google Maps APIs, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

What it does: MicroWaze is a web app built using Google Maps APIs. Users can either simply view the map to find the nearest microwave or mark a new location on the map if they run across an unmarked public microwave. The map shows the user their current location so they can determine which microwave is closest.
